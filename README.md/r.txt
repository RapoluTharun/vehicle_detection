# AI-Based Vehicle Detection System

A simple computer vision project using Haar Cascades and YOLO Lite (YOLOv3-tiny) to detect vehicles from images.

## Features
- Detects cars, buses, bikes, and trucks from images
- Lightweight model suitable for basic surveillance or parking analytics
- Built with Python and OpenCV

## Methods
- **Haar Cascade**: Lightweight, fast, limited accuracy
- **YOLO Lite (YOLOv3-tiny)**: More accurate, faster than full YOLO

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
